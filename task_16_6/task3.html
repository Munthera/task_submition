	<p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
	     <p> Jack would really like...</p>

	     <ul>
	     	<li>Roller blades</li>
	     	<li>Magic tricks</li>
	     	<li>Anything Pokemon</li>
	     	<li>A motorized Lego set</li>
	     </ul>
	     <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus</a> and  <a href="https://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a>.</p>
